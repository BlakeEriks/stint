# Time Tracking — working notes

A time tracker for solo contractors. The product thesis is **restraint**; Toggl
is the comparison point and it does too much.

Read `docs/decisions/` before changing anything structural. The four ADRs cover
choices that were made deliberately and should not be re-litigated casually.

## Non-negotiables

**One running timer per user, enforced by a database index.** Not by API code.
`POST /timer/start` returns 409 when one is running. Never add a code path that
could produce overlapping entries.

**The app never silently modifies user data.** Runaway timers are surfaced, not
auto-trimmed. Rates freeze onto invoices at generation. This is a billing
system — silent correction destroys trust in every number it reports.

**Server owns timer truth; clients own responsiveness.** A running timer ticks
locally from `startedAt`, but the server decides whether it is running.

**The accent (green `#52FC43`) appears in one place at a time: the running
timer.** Not navigation, not secondary buttons, not links. Green never means
success — success is cyan `#2CCCEB`.

**Never white text on the accent** — 1.37:1. Use `--text-on-accent`. CI guards
this specific regression.

## Conventions

- **No Server Actions** for anything Expo or Swift also needs. Everything goes
  through `/api/v1/*` route handlers.
- Colors come from **semantic** tokens only. Primitives stay in the token
  package. Never hardcode a hex in a component.
- Design tokens are **generated** — edit `packages/design-tokens/tokens.json`,
  then `pnpm tokens`. Never edit files in `dist/`.
- Durations are always mono + `tabular-nums`.
- Time entry ids are **client-generated UUIDv7** (`uuidv7()` in `@tt/core`) so
  offline retries are idempotent.
- Rate resolution exists in SQL (authoritative) and TS (previews). Keep them in
  sync; the database wins.
- `0` is a valid rate. Use null-coalescing, never truthiness.
- Archive, don't delete — invoices reference clients and projects.

## Verifying the schema

No Supabase CLI installed. To test migrations, start a throwaway Postgres
(`/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@14/bin`) on a spare port over TCP — the socket
path in the scratchpad exceeds the 103-byte limit — stub `auth.users` and
`auth.uid()`, apply both migrations, then tear it down.

## API layer

All routes live in `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/`. Shared plumbing in
`apps/web/src/lib/`:

- `auth.ts` — `requireSession()` accepts both a bearer token (Expo, macOS) and
  a cookie session (web); both yield an RLS-scoped client.
- `errors.ts` — `handle()` wraps every route; `ApiError` maps to documented
  status codes. Contains a compile-time guard asserting the local `Code` union
  matches `ErrorCode` in `@tt/schema`.
- `rows.ts` — **the only place that knows both snake_case and camelCase.**
  Rename a column here, nowhere else.
- `validate.ts` — Zod parsing with 422 + `treeifyError` details.

### Conventions

- Never pre-check the running timer before inserting. Attempt the insert and
  translate the unique-violation — a pre-check is a race, the index is not.
- Numeric columns arrive from PostgREST as **strings**; `rows.ts` converts them.
  Never pass them straight through.
- Offline replays: a duplicate-key insert with a client-supplied id returns the
  existing row with 200, not an error.
- `nextInvoiceNumber` is not client-settable — gapless numbering depends on
  `allocate_invoice_number()` holding the row lock.

### Testing

`apps/web/test/routes.test.ts` runs the **real** handlers against a **real**
Postgres with the real migrations. `requireSession` has a `__TEST_DB__` seam;
`test/shim.mjs` is a supabase-js-shaped builder over node-postgres, and
`test/loader.mjs` resolves `next/*` and the `@/` alias for `node --test`.

Node's `--experimental-strip-types` rejects **TypeScript parameter
properties** — write constructor fields explicitly in any code the tests load.

Zod 4 is used throughout: `z.uuid()`, `z.iso.datetime()`, `z.email()`,
`z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`. Keep every workspace package on the same
Zod major, or `z.infer` degrades to `unknown` across package boundaries.
